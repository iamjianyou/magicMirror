# Magic Mirror

This repository is a demonstration of what can be built with the Gemini Live API and the genmedia (e.g., Veo, Lyria, Imagen) models from the Gemini family. It is based on the [react-based starter app](https://github.com/google-gemini/live-api-web-console) and transforms it into an interactive, voice-controlled "Magic Mirror".

## Try it (until the end of the devfest season)

www.goo.gle/devfest-magic-mirror (it will talk in French by default, but you can ask it to switch to English)

## How to Run

To get started, you'll need a free Gemini API key.

1.  **Get an API Key:** Create your key at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).

2.  **Set up your environment:** Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API key like this:

    ```
    REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies and run:** Open your terminal and run the following commands:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Be aware that the Image generation model doesn't have a free tier, so you'll pay 0.039$ per image the mirror generates!**
